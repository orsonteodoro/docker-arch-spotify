# docker-arch-spotify-PaXmarked

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orsonteodoro/docker-arch-spotify-PaXmarked.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/orsonteodoro/docker-arch-spotify-PaXmarked)

This is a container containing Spotify.  It works with ALSA but can be configured or altered for PulseAudio.

It should work with hardened kernels with grsecurity.

Since it uses ALSA, you may only be able to use it in the container once your host releases the sound card.

It was tested on a host with Alpine Linux.

This requires the Docker package to use.

1. `git clone https://github.com/orsonteodoro/docker-arch-spotify.git`
2. `cd docker-arch-spotify`
3. `chmod +x compile.sh`
4. `./compile.sh`
5. `chmod +x run.sh`
6. `./run.sh`
7.  If you use Facebook, you can use your Facebook user name and password to logon.
